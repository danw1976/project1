# Sort out flash messages
# this requires checking which portion of the layout template will be rendered each time
# may need to re-organise where the flash_messages function is called - eg within the body block
# Pass username to welcome page so user can be 'welcomed'
# Once a user is logged in add them to the session variable - other logins can then be tested against this variable so there can't be multiple logins
# Add logout ability
